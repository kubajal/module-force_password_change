## Force password change module

This module gives the administrator a new functionality to block users from viewing submissions by forcing them to change their passwords beforehand. The aim is to have users use custom passwords, not the ones sent by the system or by the admin.

There are two use-cases which this module handles:

- the administrator wants the user to change their password because it has been sent as open text through e-mail/messanger/etc.,
- the user clicked on "forgot password" button on the login page; a temporary password has been sent to the user which they need now to change before viewing submissions again.
